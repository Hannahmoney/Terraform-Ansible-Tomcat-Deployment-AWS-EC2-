# 🚀 Terraform + Ansible Tomcat Deployment (AWS EC2)

This project provisions infrastructure using **Terraform** and configures a Tomcat application using **Ansible**.

It demonstrates a clear separation between:

- Infrastructure provisioning (Terraform)
- Configuration management (Ansible)

An **Ubuntu EC2 instance** was used as the Ansible control server.
